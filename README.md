CodeGenWorkshop
===============

In this workshop we'll look at how to implement a jit compiler for a custom programming language.

This covers lexical analysis with flex (lex.l), parser generation with bison (parse.yy), and code generation with llvm (jit.cc).

We'll take a look at the entire compiler and make modifications at every level. We should have time for advanced features such as capturing lexical closures.
